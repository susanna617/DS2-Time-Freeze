# DS2-Time-Freeze
A project for a human-computer interaction class, in which we remapped the keyboard input controls for Time Freeze, a game available on Armor Games, to hand gestures using MediaPipe Gesture Recognizer and PyAutoGUI. Full explanation of the design process and project is in a Medium blog: https://medium.com/@sboberg617/hands-on-the-clock-designing-gesture-based-inputs-for-time-freeze-ead90db26f9e

DS3.zip includes the user data from our Design Sprint 3 study on the effectiveness of our hand gesture control scheme vs. original keyboard inputs. Also includes the Jupyter notebook used for our data visualization.
